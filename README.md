# error-correcting-codes
Sometimes the homework takes ages to complete by hand. Instead, we should write code to automate it for us.

Currently, only the Codeword class exists.
The functions that have been implemented are getting the length, creating a
codeword, getting distance between two codewordsand adding two codewords.


Things to be done:
Setup the structure for Codeword matrices
Some functions to be added to that class should be:
Generating a codeword matrix with a basis
Adding and removing rows or columns
Using the algorithms to create a generator matrix
There's plenty more I'm not thinking about, but I'm sure there's more than
enought.
